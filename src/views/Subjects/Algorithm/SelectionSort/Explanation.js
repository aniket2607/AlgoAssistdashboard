          <h3>Definition:</h3>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm
            is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is
            divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the
            unsorted part at the right end.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the
                entire list.
              </li>{" "}
              <li>
                The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and
                swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a
                part of the sorted array.
              </li>{" "}
              <li>
                This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one
                element to the right.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Typography>
          <h3>Steps:</h3>
          <Typography>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First we try to find the minimum element in the array and swap
                it with the element on the index 0.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, we move to the second position and find the smallest
                element in the array excluding index 0 and swap it with the
                element at index 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                The above steps are then repeatedly followed until a sorted
                array is found.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Typography>

          <h3>Advantages:</h3>
          <Typography>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The main advantage of the selection sort is that it performs
                well on a small list
              </li>
              <li>
                Because it is an in-place sorting algorithm, no additional
                temporary storage is required beyond what is needed to hold the
                original list.
              </li>
              <li>
                Its performance is easily influenced by the initial ordering of
                the items before the sorting process
              </li>
            </ol>
          </Typography>
          <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
          <Typography>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The primary disadvantage of the selection sort is its poor
                efficiency when dealing with a huge list of items.
              </li>
              <li>
                The selection sort requires n-squared number of steps for
                sorting n elements.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </Typography>
